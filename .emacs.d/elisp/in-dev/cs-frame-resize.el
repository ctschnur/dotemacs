;;; Commentary:

;; make-frame-almost-fit-desktop is intended to make the current frame be almost at
;; the edge of the window, but not totally full-screen.

;;; Code:

(defun cs-frame-get-frames-monitor ()
  "Get the monitor of the FRAME."
  (car (remove nil
               (mapcar (lambda (monitor)

                           monitor))
