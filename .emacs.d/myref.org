;; TODO:
;; I am in an org file and want to cite something, that is not in crossref
;; It needs a bibtex entry, to create that, I call
org-ref-bibtex-new-entry/bibtex-Book-and-exit



;; some useful stuff i figured out how to do:

;; get the entry's text from the entry's key
(org-ref-get-bibtex-entry "elb05")

;; get the full file name of the book from search
(nth 0 (split-string (shell-command-to-string "find ~/Dropbox -name \"*elberfel*\"") "\n"))
